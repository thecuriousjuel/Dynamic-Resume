# Dynamic Resume Website

This is a modern, responsive, and interactive resume website for Biswajit Basak (thecuriousjuel).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Custom styles, responsive layouts, and section-specific stylesheets
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (theme toggle, smooth scrolling, typing effect, scroll progress bar)
- **Figma-inspired Design**: Clean, modern, and visually appealing UI

## Website Sections
- **About**: Brief introduction and personal statement
- **Skills & Interests**: Visual grid of technical skills and personal interests
- **Why Me?**: Animated typing effect highlighting strengths and qualities
- **Experience**: Timeline of professional roles with organization and location highlights
- **Education**: Academic background with university and location, styled for clarity
- **Certificates**: List of certifications with links to view credentials
- **Projects**: Showcases of key projects with links to demos, YouTube, and GitHub

## Features & Implementation
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: User can switch between dark and light modes; preference is saved in localStorage
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Navigation links smoothly scroll to sections, accounting for fixed navbar offset
- **Animated Section Fade**: Sections fade in/out as the user scrolls
- **Scroll Progress Bar**: Visual indicator of scroll position below the navbar
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to all screen sizes, including mobile
- **Section-specific CSS**: Each major section (experience, education, etc.) has its own stylesheet for maintainability
